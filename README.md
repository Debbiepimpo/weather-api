# weather-api

For making weather-api work in your local:

1. I create a `.env`file on the root.
2. I create the environment variable file with:

| Key                 | Value                     |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| API_KEY             | `<my_api_key>`            |

The API key was given by the company.
